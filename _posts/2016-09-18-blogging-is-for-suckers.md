## Bloggin’ is for suckers!.. Or so I've tried to convince myself. ##

For the last eight years, my internet presence has been very **careful**. 

My Facebook audience is geared towards members of my close/distant relatives, friends from my hometown and/or cool folks I’ve met along the way. I update with photos of the different shades I decide to have Frank dye my hair and the trendy glasses to seek out to match. Logged are the neat places my partner and I decide to adventure, obscure foods we try and cute diy projects I do with kiddies. I throw out inquiries for apps, nutritional advice or new fitness regiments, hoping to gain better feedback than asking good ol' Google.. But the reality is that the only piece of technology that excites me is the color coordinated Google calendar I can access with one swipe to the right on my cell phone.

# I hold a heavy weight on my chest from the days where I did nothing but overshare on the web. #

**Back to the roots of anxiety.**

In my early teens, the web was my _livelihood_. I had a very emo livejournal that highlighted the trials and tribulations of my young love life (with pix and a lot of outside opinions, /cringe). I had created an internet community that invited “sexy, sweet beauties” to fill out an application, surveying their mind and body and choosing the coolest young ladies and gents to be a part of our blog-brigade. MySpace was a platform for my side bangs and sass to generate shock value from e-friends near and far. An uncanny amount of hours were spent sharing music, stories and phone calls with other tweens via forums, hoping my parents wouldn’t pick up the phone and hear the line being tied up by our dial-up connection. I formed an intense identity on the web; through my well thought out away messages (full of serious spacing, bolds and italics) that synced sad songs with my seriously sappy feelings. 

..But then! **I got some friends irl**.

Gone were the days of having my little sister dance to Missy Elliot songs while I balanced on a yoga giant ball on webcam. Goodbye to my PaintShop Pro Pokecards and nicknames combining my name with a dinosaurs. In were weekend shows, mosh pits, disco fries and cigarettes (gross) after a week in my khaki colored uniform skirt and wrinkleless navy polo shirt. I found a bunch of friends to share in my woes with, debate animal rights and who supported me rocking a camera strap around my neck wherever we went. The internet became obsolete, nobody wanted to call my mom and complain about the inappropriate things I had typed in my “bio” on my webpage anymore. 

Fast-Forward

I’m an adult woman doing some pretty great things for myself! I teach in a classroom where I’m surrounded by culture, a thirst for learning, and enrichment that I can provide. I get to make chalkboards in exchange for free goods, kind of like real life Oregon Trail. I have a partner who loves every single crazy little piece of me. I speak to the most perfect therapist who slaps me with some real talk whenever I fall off track. I swear by my anti-depressants, that saved me from my anxiety and spinning gears that never seemed to stop turning. Life is good! But something is missing.

I miss the connection I had with the web.

I’ve got all of these great things I feel positive and excited about, and I constantly doodle and document and dream about the possibilities and “if only’s”, and I think it’s time I share them. I want this blog to be the outlet I’ve been looking for.
